Time complexity of str.replace(old string, new string, instance)

Time complexity:

Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. 
It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm.

When str1.replace() function is called, a copy of str1 is created. 
However during the copying process, new string will be added in places of old string. 
The function will finally return the modified copy. The time complexity will the length of the modified string,
i.e, O(length of string returned by replace function)  

Space complexity

Space complexity is determined as a function of input. 
It is the measure of the memory space required to run the algorithm for the given input.
